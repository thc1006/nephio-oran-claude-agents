# Nephio-O-RAN Claude Code Agents Collection

A comprehensive collection of specialized AI subagents for Nephio and O-RAN integration, designed to automate cloud-native telecommunications infrastructure deployment and management.

## Overview

This repository contains 8 specialized subagents that extend Claude Code's capabilities for telecom automation. Each subagent is an expert in specific domains of Nephio-O-RAN integration, automatically invoked based on context or explicitly called when needed. All agents are configured with appropriate Claude models based on task complexity for optimal performance and cost-effectiveness.

git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/nephio-oran-claude-agents.git .claude/agents
```

## Quick Start

### Automatic Agent Invocation
Claude Code automatically delegates tasks to appropriate agents based on context:

```

```markdown
# End-to-end orchestration
"Implement complete 5G service deployment across multiple sites"
```

```markdown
# Infrastructure management
"Use nephio-infrastructure-agent to optimize resource allocation across edge sites"
```

```markdown
# O-RAN specific tasks
"Have oran-network-functions-agent deploy xApps with proper RIC integration"
```

```markdown
# Complex orchestration
"Get nephio-oran-orchestrator-agent to design end-to-end service lifecycle automation"
```

## Usage Examples

## Agent Architecture Patterns

### Sequential Orchestration
```
User Request ‚Üí Infrastructure Agent ‚Üí Network Functions Agent ‚Üí Orchestrator Agent ‚Üí Result

Example: "Deploy complete 5G service"

```

### Parallel Processing
```
User Request ‚Üí Multiple Agents (simultaneously) ‚Üí Coordinated Result

Example: "Optimize network performance across all domains"
performance-optimization-agent + monitoring-analytics-agent + configuration-management-agent
```

### Validation Workflows
```
Primary Agent ‚Üí Security/Compliance Agent ‚Üí Validated Implementation

```

## Best Practices

### üéØ Task Delegation Strategy
1. **Leverage automatic delegation** - Let Claude Code route tasks based on context analysis
2. **Provide comprehensive context** - Include infrastructure details, compliance requirements, and performance constraints
3. **Trust specialized expertise** - Each agent is optimized for specific telecom domains

### üîÑ Multi-Agent Coordination
4. **Design workflow sequences** - Plan complex operations as agent collaboration patterns
5. **Maintain context consistency** - Ensure agents have necessary background for coordinated operations
6. **Validate integration points** - Verify outputs from different agents work together effectively

### üìà Operational Excellence
7. **Monitor agent performance** - Track effectiveness and optimize agent selection patterns
8. **Implement feedback loops** - Use operational results to refine agent capabilities
9. **Scale based on complexity** - Match agent model capabilities to task requirements

## Key Design Principles

### Accessibility and Discoverability

The repository structure prioritizes **immediate usability** by placing agent files at the root level, following the proven pattern of successful Claude Code agent repositories. This ensures that users can quickly clone and start using agents without complex navigation or setup procedures.

### Comprehensive Documentation Strategy

The README.md serves as both an introduction and a comprehensive reference, combining **quick-start accessibility with detailed technical information**. This dual-purpose approach accommodates both newcomers seeking immediate value and experienced users requiring detailed implementation guidance.

### Community-Focused Design

Following open-source best practices, the repository includes essential community files (CONTRIBUTING.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, SECURITY.md) that establish clear expectations and processes for collaboration. This infrastructure supports sustainable community growth and contribution management.

### Practical Examples and Templates

The inclusion of extensive examples and templates reduces barriers to adoption and customization. Users can quickly understand agent capabilities through real-world scenarios while having the resources needed to extend or modify agents for their specific requirements.

This repository design leverages proven patterns from successful open-source projects while addressing the specialized requirements of telecom automation, creating a comprehensive resource for Nephio-O-RAN integration that can grow with community contributions and evolving technological requirements.
