# 🚀 PR Implementation Guide - Agent Collaboration System

## Overview

This PR adds a complete agent collaboration system to the Nephio-O-RAN Claude Code Agents repository, enabling automated multi-agent workflows.

## 📦 Files to Add

### 1. Create Directory Structure

```bash
# From repository root
mkdir -p orchestration/workflows
mkdir -p scripts
mkdir -p ~/.claude-workflows  # For runtime state
```

### 2. Add Core Files

#### A. Main Orchestrator
Save `orchestration/orchestrator.py` from the artifacts provided:
- Full-featured Python orchestrator
- Supports 4 built-in workflows
- State management
- Report generation

#### B. Simple Bash Runner
Save `scripts/run-workflow.sh` from the artifacts:
- No Python required
- Simple sequential execution
- Color-coded output
- Basic state tracking

#### C. Agent Updater
Save `scripts/update-agents.py` from the artifacts:
- Adds standard output format to all agents
- Adds workflow integration info
- One-time update script

### 3. Make Scripts Executable

```bash
chmod +x orchestration/orchestrator.py
chmod +x scripts/run-workflow.sh
chmod +x scripts/update-agents.py
```

## 🔧 Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Update Agent Files

Run the update script to add collaboration protocol to all agents:

```bash
python3 scripts/update-agents.py
```

This will:
- Add standard output format section to each agent
- Add workflow participation info
- Add handoff specifications

### Step 2: Test Basic Workflow

Test with the simple bash runner:

```bash
./scripts/run-workflow.sh deploy
```

Expected output:
```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
   Nephio-O-RAN Agent Workflow Runner
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

🚀 Starting DEPLOYMENT workflow
📍 Stage 1/6: infrastructure
   Agent: nephio-infrastructure-agent
   ✅ Status: SUCCESS
   ➡️  Suggested handoff to: oran-nephio-dep-doctor
...
✅ WORKFLOW COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY!
```

### Step 3: Test Advanced Orchestrator

For more features, use the Python orchestrator:

```bash
# Dry run first
python3 orchestration/orchestrator.py deploy --dry-run

# Actual execution
python3 orchestration/orchestrator.py deploy

# With verbose output
python3 orchestration/orchestrator.py deploy --verbose
```

## 📋 Available Workflows

### 1. Deploy (Complete Deployment)
```bash
./scripts/run-workflow.sh deploy
```
Stages:
1. Infrastructure provisioning
2. Dependency validation
3. Configuration management
4. Network function deployment
5. Monitoring setup
6. Performance optimization

### 2. Troubleshoot (Issue Resolution)
```bash
./scripts/run-workflow.sh troubleshoot
```
Stages:
1. Issue diagnosis
2. Root cause analysis
3. Remediation
4. Verification

### 3. Validate (Security & Compliance)
```bash
./scripts/run-workflow.sh validate
```
Stages:
1. Security scanning
2. Dependency checking
3. Performance baselining

### 4. Upgrade (System Upgrade)
```bash
./scripts/run-workflow.sh upgrade
```
Stages:
1. Pre-upgrade check
2. Backup
3. Infrastructure upgrade
4. Network function upgrade
5. Validation

## 🎯 Quick Start Examples

### Example 1: Simple Deployment
```bash
# Run complete deployment
./scripts/run-workflow.sh deploy

# Check results
cat ~/.claude-workflows/*/report.txt
```

### Example 2: Manual Agent Chaining
```bash
# Execute first agent
claude code "Use nephio-infrastructure-agent to deploy infrastructure"

# Check handoff suggestion in output
# Execute next agent based on handoff
claude code "Use oran-nephio-dep-doctor to validate dependencies"
```

### Example 3: Python Orchestrator with Custom ID
```bash
python3 orchestration/orchestrator.py deploy --workflow-id my-deployment-001
```

## 📊 State Management

All workflow state is saved in `~/.claude-workflows/<workflow-id>/`:
- `state.json` - Complete workflow state
- `workflow.log` - Execution log
- `stage-*.txt` - Individual stage outputs
- `report.txt` - Final summary report

## ✅ Validation Checklist

After implementation, verify:

- [ ] All agent files have standard output format section
- [ ] Scripts are executable
- [ ] Basic workflow runs successfully
- [ ] State files are created in ~/.claude-workflows/
- [ ] Handoff suggestions appear in output
- [ ] Report is generated at workflow completion

## 🔄 Integration with Existing Code

The collaboration system is fully compatible with existing code:
- No breaking changes to agent functionality
- Agents can still be used individually
- Token monitoring continues to work
- Test suites remain valid

## 📝 Update README.md

Add this section to your main README:

```markdown
## 🤝 Multi-Agent Workflows

### Automated Workflows
Run complete workflows with one command:
\`\`\`bash
# Deploy O-RAN infrastructure
./scripts/run-workflow.sh deploy

# Troubleshoot issues
./scripts/run-workflow.sh troubleshoot

# Validate security
./scripts/run-workflow.sh validate
\`\`\`

### Python Orchestrator
For advanced features:
\`\`\`bash
python3 orchestration/orchestrator.py deploy --verbose
\`\`\`

### Manual Chaining
Follow handoff suggestions:
1. Run first agent
2. Check `handoff_to` field in output
3. Run suggested next agent
4. Repeat until workflow complete
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "claude: command not found"
**Solution**: Ensure Claude Code is installed and in PATH

### Issue: Scripts not executing
**Solution**: Make executable with `chmod +x scripts/*.sh`

### Issue: Python import errors
**Solution**: Install PyYAML: `pip install pyyaml`

### Issue: No output from agents
**Solution**: Agents may need time to process. Check `~/.claude-workflows/*/` for outputs

## 🚦 Testing the Implementation

### Basic Test
```bash
# Should create infrastructure and suggest next agent
claude code "Use nephio-infrastructure-agent to deploy test cluster and provide handoff_to suggestion"
```

### Workflow Test
```bash
# Should complete all 6 stages
./scripts/run-workflow.sh deploy
```

### State Verification
```bash
# Should show JSON state file
cat ~/.claude-workflows/*/state.json | python3 -m json.tool
```

## 📈 Benefits

This implementation provides:
1. **Automated Workflows** - No manual agent chaining needed
2. **State Persistence** - Workflows can be resumed
3. **Error Handling** - Failed stages are clearly marked
4. **Progress Tracking** - Real-time status updates
5. **Report Generation** - Summary of all actions taken
6. **Flexibility** - Use bash for simple, Python for advanced

## 🎉 Success Criteria

The implementation is successful when:
- ✅ All 4 workflows execute completely
- ✅ Agents hand off correctly
- ✅ State is preserved between stages
- ✅ Reports are generated
- ✅ Both bash and Python orchestrators work

## 📞 Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the workflow log: `~/.claude-workflows/*/workflow.log`
2. Verify agent output format compliance
3. Ensure all scripts have execute permissions
4. Review individual stage outputs
